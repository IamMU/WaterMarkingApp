# WaterMarkingApp
A simple water marking app made with python.
## Usage
To start using the water marking app, download the two python files, and make sure the dependencies are met. You can also download an executable file if 
it is available.
After installing everything, simply run the program.
It shows a GUI, and it is very self-explanatory what to do next.
If you want to use the same directory as the program to save the image, just leave it blank, and or open the file explorer and then click cancel. It will
display a *red* text, which will tell you, that it is going to save the image in the same directory as the program.
After setting up everything, click on *Add Watermark*, after which the other two buttons will be enabled. 
First click on the *show image* button to see your image. 
**NOTE**: When you click on *show image* it might show the image's transparent background as well. This will not be part of the saved file!
After seeing the image click on the *save image* button. The file will be saved to the directory specified.
